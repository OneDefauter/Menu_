Get standard time fields and convert they to/from number of milliseconds.

StdTime [time|milliseconds [/L]]

Show the value of Hour, Min, Sec and MSec fields of the time given in locale format;
if no parameter is given, current time is used.
All fields shown will have left zeros if needed to fill their widths.
At end, return the equivalent number of milliseconds in ERRORLEVEL.
If the given time is invalid, nothing is shown and return zero.

If the parameter is a plain number with no time separators, a number of milliseconds
is assumed; in this case, show the equivalent time in standard 24-hour format
(ie: HH:MM:SS) and return it as HHMMSSmmm decimal value in ERRORLEVEL.
If /L switch is also given, use 12-hour am/pm format to show the time.
