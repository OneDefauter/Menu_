Get or set the file pointer position of a redirected file handle.

   FilePointer handle position [/C|/E]

If no /C nor /E options are given, move the file pointer to the 31-bits
absolute position given (files up to 2 GB size).

If /C option is given, move the file pointer relative to current position
(signed displacement).

If /E option is given, move the file pointer relative to end of file.
For example, to move FP to EOF: FilePointer handle 0 /E

When this program ends, it returns the new FP position in ERRORLEVEL.
For example, to get the current FP position:
    FilePointer handle 0 /C
    set position=%errorlevel%
