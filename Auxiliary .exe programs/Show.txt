Show characters from Ascii codes, string literals and Batch variables.

   Show { code[*times] | "literal" | variable[:[ñ]wide[:fill]] } ...

<code>, <times>, <wide> and <fill> must be decimal numbers up to 255 each.

<times> repeat the previous Ascii <code> character that number of times;
a "X" letter may be used instead of the asterisk.

or justified at rigth if <wide> have minus sign, or centered if <wide> have
plus sign; the field is filled with spaces, or with the <fill> code character.

At end, the number of displayed characters is returned in ERRORLEVEL.
